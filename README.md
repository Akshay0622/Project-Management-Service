# Project-Management-Service
In simple terms, a project management service is like a toolbox that helps people organize and oversee projects. It provides tools and features to plan tasks, assign them to team members, keep track of progress, and communicate with everyone involved. It's a way to keep everything organized and moving smoothly from start to finish.
